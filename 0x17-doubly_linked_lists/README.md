# The solution to the ALX Project: 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
----------

* Here the doubly linked lists indicates that each node has the ability to link to previous node and the next node on the lists.
* This means it has 2 links (i.e it is doubly linked).
* It is very similar to the singly linked lists; the big difference is how the nodes are defined.
* For instance in the doubly linked lists, nodes are defined as:
        struct node 
{
          int data;
          node* next;
          node* prev;
};

\\ For this project, I am required to input my Prototypes of all my functions in the header file ``lists.h``
