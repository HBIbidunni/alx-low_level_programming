# ALX Project: C - Makefiles
--------

- __Makefiles__ are the core of this project and they are text files that contain a set of instructions to build and manage this software project, in __C__ and __C++__ programming languages. 

- __Makefiles__ are typically used in Unix-based systems, but they can also be used in other environments with suitable tools installed, such as __GNU Make__.

- The purpose of a __Makefile__ is to automate the compilation and linking process of a project, ensuring that only the necessary files are rebuilt when changes occur.

- A __Makefile__ consists of a series of rules, each of which specifies a target and the dependencies required to build that target. The basic structure of a rule is as follows:

```
target: dependencies
   command
```

- The `target` represents the file that needs to be built, while the `dependencies` are the files or targets that the `target` depends on. The `command` is the set of instructions to be executed when building the `target`. The commands are usually written using shell syntax.

Here's an example of a simple __Makefile__ that builds a __C__ program called `myprogram` from two source files, `main.c` and `utils.c`:

```
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra

myprogram: main.o utils.o
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o myprogram main.o utils.o

main.o: main.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

utils.o: utils.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c utils.c

clean:
    rm -f myprogram main.o utils.o
```


- In this example, the __Makefile__ defines three rules: __myprogram__, __main.o__, and __utils.o__. The __myprogram__ rule specifies that it depends on __main.o__ and __utils.o__, and the command is used to link these object files into the final executable myprogram. The __main.o__ and __utils.o__ rules specify the compilation of the respective source files into object files using the `-c` flag.

- Additionally, the __Makefile__ includes a clean rule, which is not tied to any file. It provides a convenient way to remove the built files using the __rm__ command.

- To use the __Makefile__, navigate to the directory containing the __Makefile__ in a terminal and run the make command. It will analyze the dependencies and execute the necessary commands to build the target. For example, running make __myprogram__ will build the __myprogram__ target.

- In conclusion, __Makefiles__ are powerful tools for managing complex projects with multiple source files, libraries, and dependencies. They provide an automated and efficient way to build software, making it easier to maintain and update projects.
